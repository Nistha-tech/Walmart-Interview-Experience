# Walmart-Interview-Experience

I'm currently an SWE Intern at Walmart, India! I applied to it via the CODEHERS competition on the D2C platform in 2021. 
## Round-1: 
It was a MCQ challenge, there were 25 questions to be solved within 30 minutes. Questions were mostly on Computer Science fundamentals covering Operating Systems, Computer Networks, DBMS, and OOPs. 

## Round-2:
It was a coding challenge. There were 2 coding questions to be solved within 90 minutes. They were DSA based questions covering all the topics. There were many sets of questions so difficulty also varies according to sets. I would say it to be of medium-hard level. 


**Results were announced!**

There were 2 lists generated for shortlisted and waitlisted. As far as I know, only shortlisted ones got the interview opportunity. There wasn't a cut-off; instead, it was based on your score and rank you achieved. So try to score more in both the OA rounds. 

**Interviews were conducted in September 2021 for 6 months SWE Internship.**

## Interview Round-1: 
It was a technical interview that included questions based on DSA, CS fundamentals, Machine Learning & Azure (as it was mentioned in my resume).

It started with the introduction and then he directly jumped to DSA questions. I was mostly asked questions on HashMap and DP. I had to open my IDE and code and run the desired test cases. 
Then I was asked some OOPs concepts followed by a few implementations. Then I was asked questions based on OS. 
My interviewer had good knowledge of ML and Azure so he started grilling me on those algos and then I discussed building a model based on these principles. 
Towards the end, I was asked 1-2 leadership questions. 

I got an email in about an hour that I've been shortlisted for round-2. 

## Interview Round-2: 
It was the Hiring Manager round. The interviewer was very sweet and helpful. He asked me about my projects and a few technical questions based on them. Then he asked me a few situation-based questions. 
You'll surely be cross-questioned once you answer this so was I but make sure you're confident with your answer. Then he asked me a few leadership questions. It went up to 45 mins. 
He seem to be very impressed and told me in the interview: "It's a green flag from my side and you'll be getting the selection email in a few hours" 

I was literally happy after this and got the selection email in half-hour. 

**All the interviews took place on the same day and it was a great experience.**

I hope this helps! Please feel free to reach out to me in case you have any doubts. 

GOOD LUCK! Keep Coding ❤️
